# Image Compression Project
This is a project I have completed for my Applied Linear Algebra class at
Azusa Pacific University during my sophomore year. This was done using 
MATLAB, and it the goal of this project was to be able to create images 
that weighted less than the original picture, while still maintaining a 
good quality.

# Preview
<img src="/Original Image.png" width = "400"/>
<img src="/Compressed Image.png" width = "400"/> 
<img src="/Colors.png" width = "400"/> <br/>

# How to use
This application was developed using the **MATLAB**. Hence, simply download the 
script and run it in the MATLAB prorgam to be able to use it. <br/>
Make sure that in the folder where you run the script, there is an image with the 
same name as the one being utilized in the program.

# Technologies used:
**MATLAB** - As the only tool to come up with this funcionality.
